# valorant-buddy

Ever want a cute friend to accompany you as you play valorant? Well, here it is. This was a quick project (one night) that I made for my girlfriend who has a moderate Valorant addiction :)

The program uses Tkinter to generate transparent windows that display the cat (buddy) sprite and the custom sign. The buddy cat moves randomly and the sign says whether you are on Valorant or not (I suppose it would be easy to tell that though..)

I wanted to implement reactions when you get a kill, etc, but the current valorant-py api does not support live match data. In the future, I want to make the buddy a bit more reactive.

Sprites **heavily** inspired by this [Medium Article](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/create-your-own-desktop-pet-with-python-5b369be18868), give it a look!
